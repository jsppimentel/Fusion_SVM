Fusion SVM and Speed ​​Up SVM Implementation

This folder contains the implementations used in the article "A novel fusion Support Vector Machine integrating weak and sphere models for classification challenges with massive data" published in the Decision Analytics magazine. Each model is separated into R code, and to execute them it is necessary to use the code corresponding to the model and the "Aux.R" code.
